Description:
- Raised across **Ordanâ€™s farmlands**, particularly in **Brighthollow and Emberstead**.
- Provide **meat, tough hide, and alchemically useful bristles** that stiffen when threatened.
- Despite their aggressive nature, well-trained Bristlehogs make excellent **foragers and pest controllers**.
