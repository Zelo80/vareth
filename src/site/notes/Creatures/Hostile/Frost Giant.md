### Traits

**Icy Constitution.**  
The Frost Goliath is immune to cold and automatically succeeds on saving throws against weather-based environmental hazards (blizzards, sleet, extreme cold).

**Frozen Stomp.**  
When the Frost Goliath uses its movement to jump down or charge 20 feet or more in a straight line, it can attempt to slam the ground (see _Glacial Quake_) as a bonus action.

**Glacial Skin.**  
The first time each round that the Frost Goliath is hit with a melee weapon attack, the attacker must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or have their weapon briefly freeze to their grip—disadvantage on their next attack until the end of their next turn.

### Actions

**Multiattack.**  
The Frost Goliath makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
Hit: 21 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.

**Glacial Quake (Recharge 5–6).**  
The Goliath slams the ground with both fists. All creatures within 15 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and take 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. Creatures that fail the save also have their speed halved until the end of their next turn due to freezing shock.
