**Frost Flare (1/day).**  
When first bloodied (reduced to half HP), the goliath releases a blast of cold. Each creature within 5 ft. must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 4 (1d8) cold damage and have their speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.

### Description

A **Frost Goliath Whelp** is a malformed or adolescent version of a greater frost giant—barely intelligent, highly territorial, and often found haunting icy ravines, crumbling glacial ruins, or enchanted snowfields near old moonfern blooms or ancient coldbound magic.
