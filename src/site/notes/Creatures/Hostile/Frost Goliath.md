### Appearance

Frost Goliaths appear as hulking humanoids with bluish skin, tangled white hair, and tusk-like teeth. Their patchwork armor is laced with frost, and ice crystals cling to their weapons and joints. Unlike true frost giants, they are more beastlike, more primal—often bound to specific mountain passes, frozen glades, or cursed ruins.
