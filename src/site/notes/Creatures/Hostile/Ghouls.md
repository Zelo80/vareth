**Cursed beings that feast on the flesh of the dead**, stronger and faster than zombies.
- Undead are seen as **a blight**—where they appear, **fire follows**.
- Many **Adventurer’s Guilds** specialize in **purging graveyards, old ruins, and haunted lands**.
- There are whispers that **some noble houses secretly employ necromancers**, using the dead as **eternal servants**.
