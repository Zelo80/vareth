Description:![Pasted image 20250330100113.png](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020250330100113.png)
Goblins are **filthy, wretched creatures**, known for **breeding faster than they can be hunted**. Unlike the orcs, they have no **honor or strength**, only **cunning, cruelty, and an endless hunger for more.**

#### **Culture & Society**

- They **scavenge, steal, and infest ruins**, turning old castles and tombs into **squalid goblin nests**.
- Goblins are ruled by **whoever is the meanest**, with leaders **constantly being killed and replaced**.
- They make **crude weapons from bones, rusted metal, and stolen scraps**, their armor often **stitched together from the flesh of their own dead**.
- Some goblins claim to hear **whispers from the dark**, speaking of **some ancient, forgotten god that waits beneath the earth**.

#### **Hunted by Civilization**

- Goblins are treated **like rats**, and **entire guilds exist just to exterminate them**.
- Many nobles **pay bounties for goblin ears**, believing that the only good goblin is **a dead one**.
- Despite this, **no matter how many are killed, more always seem to appear**, as if they are being **spawned from the darkness itself**.
