Hobgoblins are **the last remnants of a forgotten empire**, a race of **fallen warlords and shattered legions**, clinging to **old ways in a world that has abandoned them**. Unlike goblins, they are **strong, disciplined, and strategic**, but they are **hunted just the same.**

#### **Culture & Society**

- They live in **hidden war camps**, training for **wars they can never win**.
- Hobgoblins are obsessed with **military order, hierarchy, and discipline**, believing that **only the strong deserve to rule**.
- They refuse to worship gods, for the gods **betrayed them long ago**, leaving them to **die at the hands of the so-called "civilized races."**
- Some believe in the **Forgotten Legion**, an army of hobgoblins so powerful that one day, they will **rise from the ruins and burn the world to the ground.**

#### **Hunted by Civilization**

- Hobgoblins are seen as **a greater threat than orcs**, for they have **the minds of conquerors**.
- Their **war camps are purged whenever found**, often with **entire armies being sent to wipe out just a single stronghold**.
- Yet, for every warband that falls, another rises, for **they will never bow, never kneel, never surrende**
