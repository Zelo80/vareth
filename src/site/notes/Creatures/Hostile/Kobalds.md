Kobolds are **small, reptilian creatures**, often found **in deep tunnels, abandoned ruins, or dragon graves**. Unlike the others, they do not fight **out of greed or bloodlust**â€”they fight because they believe they are the **chosen servants of the ancient dragons**.

#### **Culture & Society**

- They build **elaborate tunnel networks**, filling them with **traps, hidden passages, and tunnels too small for larger races**.
- They worship the **bones of dead dragons**, believing that one day, their ancestors will **rise again**.
- Kobold shamans claim to see **visions of a great serpent-god**, calling them to **burn the world and reclaim their place at the top of the food chain**.

#### **Hunted by Civilization**

- Kobolds are often **enslaved or slaughtered**, seen as **pests, not people**.
- Their **tunnels are collapsed, their tribes burned**, and yet they **always return, more vicious and hateful than before.**
