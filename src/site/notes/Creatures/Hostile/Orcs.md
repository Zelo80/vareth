Orcs are **the strongest and most feared of the Warborn**, forming **loosely organized warbands** that **live and die by the sword**. They do not seek peace, nor do they desire empires—**they fight because battle is all they have ever known.**

#### **Culture & Society**

- **Orcs live in warbands**, moving through the **wilderness, caves, and ruined cities**, striking against settlements before vanishing.
- They follow the rule of the **strongest**, where leaders must constantly **prove themselves in battle or be overthrown**.
- They do not **build**, they **take**—the weapons, armor, and tools they use are scavenged from the dead or stolen from the weak.
- Their gods are **silent and dead**, so they revere **their ancestors**, believing that when they die in battle, **they fight forever in the spirit world**.

#### **Hunted by Civilization**

- The **Adventurer’s Guild** sees **orc warbands as a plague**, sending **mercenaries, knights, and hunters** to wipe them out.
- Some orcs are taken alive, **enslaved in arenas**, where their only escape is **to fight until they die**.
- It is said that **when the last orc dies, the gods of battle will return, seeking vengeance upon the world.**
