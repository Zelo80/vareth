- Found roaming the **misty forests and silver-tinged valleys** of the **Celestine Highlands**.
    
- Their **thick, gleaming fur** and **luminous silver eyes** give them an almost ethereal presence under moonlight.
    
- Revered and feared by locals, as they have been known to **defend ancient ruins and hidden moonshrines** with **unwavering ferocity**.
