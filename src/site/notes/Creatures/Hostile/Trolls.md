- Trolls are **massive, solitary monsters**, **feared for their ability to heal from any wound**.
- They have **no gods, no purpose, no reason**â€”they **exist, they eat, they survive**.
- Some say that the **oldest trolls remember the first days of the world**, but no one has lived long enough to ask them.
