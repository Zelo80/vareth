Status: [[Rules/Celestial\|Celestial]]
Description:
Dispater appeared as a 7 ft (2.1 m) tall, dark-haired humanoid with sable skin as cold and hard as iron. His infernal heritage was revealed in several aspects of figure: his glowing, red eyes, small horns, pointed tail, and cloven left hoof. The devilishly handsome archduke dressed in only the finest attire, such as his red robes or velvet gloves, and always wielded his mace-like rod.
