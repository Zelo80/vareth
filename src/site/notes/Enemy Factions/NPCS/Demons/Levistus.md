#npc ![Levistus_Dark_alliance.webp](/img/user/Images/Levistus_Dark_alliance.webp)
Status: [[Rules/Celestial\|Celestial]]
Description:
Levistus's true appearance was widely unknown, as from the outside of his glacial prison he could only be seen as a small black blot a quarter-mile within the mountain of dark ice. The ice was also transparently blue enough that onlookers could perceive his frustrated posture from any angle. On close inspection, Levistus appeared to be a 6 ft (1.8 m) tall humanoid male with dark hair, a neat goatee and an extremely pale complexion, but would be able pass for a human if not for his traditionally fiendish traits; his pointed teeth and coal-black eyes that practically radiated darkness. In the days of his freedom, he wore loose, silken clothing and carried a shining rapier, now donning fanciful garments and other finery when meeting mortals in projected form.When appearing as an aspect, the air around him was chilling and his clothes were always partially frozen and dripping with water.
