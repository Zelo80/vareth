Status: [[Rules/Celestial\|Celestial]]
Description:
Malkizid appeared as a nearly 10 ft (3 m) tall humanoid with marble white skin, a pair of huge wings that shed shabby gray feathers, and a long serpentine tail. His hands and feet were gray with bird-like talons. Two black horns curled from the sides of his head, and a long mane of hair fell down his back. Malkizid's humanoid face could have been considered handsome, except for the cold black pits that were his eyes and the large mark that was been branded (by Corellon) on his forehead that trickled a seep of foul blood.
