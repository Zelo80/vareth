#npc ![Zariel%2C_Archduke_of_Avernus_AFR.webp](/img/user/Images/Zariel%252C_Archduke_of_Avernus_AFR.webp)
Status: [[Rules/Celestial\|Celestial]]
Description:
Zariel's original form was that of a beautiful solar with flawless skin, gold-feathered wings, and a blindfold covering her eyes.

After her descent, she took on a more diabolical appearance: a halo of fire burned atop her head, her once-fine skin was scorched, and her angelic wings, ruined by flame, turned leathery. Her blindfold was abandoned, fully revealing eyes that glowed with white-hot rage, and she had lost one of her hands and replaced it with a flail.
