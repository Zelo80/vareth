Description:
Maladomini was the seventh layer of the Nine Hells of Baator. Ruled by the archdevil Baalzebul, it was the center for all bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, a byzantine labyrinth of information where every document and deed of the infernal plane was eventually archived. The Circle of Ruins, sometimes titled of the Ruins was a testament to the degeneracy of the Lord of the Flies, its crumbling, imperfect structures the legacy of his pursuit of unattainable perfection.
