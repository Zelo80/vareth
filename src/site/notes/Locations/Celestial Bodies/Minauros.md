Description:
Minauros was the third layer of the Nine Hells of Baator. Ruled by the archdevil Mammon, the Endless Bog was the economic center of the Nine Hells, where new souls were processed and minted, its great wealth belied by its ramshackle appearance and unenjoyed by the vast majority. The Stinking Mire was the layer of greed and the avaricious, a wretched fen of toxic influence that promised only sickness and despair, slowly pulling everything beneath the putrid mud.
