Description:
Phlegethos was the fourth layer of the Nine Hells of Baator. Ruled by the archdevils Belial and Fierna, it was the center of the Nine Hells' judicial system, where devils and mortals alike navigated the impossibly intricate legalities of Baator and faced both the ecstatic highs of victory and the excruciating lows of defeat. The Heart of Flames, sometimes titled of the Flame, was the most classically infernal of the Nine Hells, a fiery desolation of officiated debauchery and damnation.
