Description:
Stygia was the fifth layer of the Nine Hells of Baator. Ruled by the archdevil Levistus, the Frozen Wastes, much like its prince, was a strange part of Hell's hierarchy, fulfilling no explicit function. Instead, the untamed expanse that was the Great Sea was a proving ground, an environment of cruel cold and active conflict that tested the prowess and endurance of infernal soldiers against monstrous beings that did not fear them. Stygia was named after the River Styx, which crisscrossed its entire extent.
