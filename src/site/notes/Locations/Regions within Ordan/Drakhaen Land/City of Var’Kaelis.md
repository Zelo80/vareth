#MainLocation
Description:
#### **Overview:**

Var’Kaelis, the formidable capital of **Drakhaen**, is a city of **obsidian towers, storm-forged magic, and unbreakable fortifications**. Carved directly into the cliffs of the **Drakhaen Peaks**, its skyline is dominated by **rune-covered spires** and **floating battle platforms**, while its streets are filled with **scholars of war, elemental forgemasters, and elite battlemages**. Unlike the celestial glow of **Veyl’thir**, Var’Kaelis is a city where **power is tangible, carved into stone and steel**, a monument to the unyielding nature of Drakhaen’s people.
