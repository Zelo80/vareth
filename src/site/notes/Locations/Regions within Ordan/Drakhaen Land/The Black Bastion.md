Description:
- A **colossal obsidian fortress**, serving as both the **royal palace and military command center** of Drakhaen.
- Built into the mountainside, its walls are **reinforced with war magic**, making them nearly impervious to siege weapons.
- Lightning-infused **storm spires** are positioned around the stronghold, capable of unleashing **magical storms** upon intruders.
- The **Stormlords’ Council**, a gathering of **Drakhaen’s greatest battle-mages**, convenes here to oversee the kingdom’s military campaigns.
- Below the fortress lies the **Vault of Titans**, a heavily guarded chamber where **forbidden war spells and relics of the Old Wars** are sealed away.
