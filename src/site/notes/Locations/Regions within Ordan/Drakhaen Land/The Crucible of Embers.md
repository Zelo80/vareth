#SubLocation
Description:
- The **largest war-forge in Ordan**, where weapons, armor, and **elemental-infused siege engines** are crafted.
- Lava flows beneath the forges, channeled into **arcane crucibles** that allow smiths to create **runebound steel and ember-infused weapons**.
- **Pyrelis’ most gifted war-smiths** often travel here to study and refine their techniques.
- The **Anvil of Kings**, a legendary artifact, is housed here—an anvil said to be unbreakable, upon which only the **greatest weapons of Drakhaen’s history** have been forged.
- A secretive **order of rune-weavers** inscribes **battle-enhancing enchantments** into the very walls of the city, ensuring its defenses remain unmatched.
