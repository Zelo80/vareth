#SubLocation
Description:
- A vast, **magically-scarred battlefield** on the outskirts of the city, where **warriors, mages, and elementalists** hone their skills.
- The land here is **permanently altered** by past magical conflicts—**floating shards of blackstone, storms that never fade, and remnants of battlefield enchantments** create an ever-changing, unpredictable training ground.
- Used for **war games, magical duels, and large-scale combat training**, as well as **elite trials for those seeking to join the Obsidian Vanguard**.
- **Stormcallers**, specialized elementalists, use this region to test the limits of **lightning magic and battle sorcery**.
- It is said that beneath the shattered ground, **ancient relics from the war with Lunareth** still lie buried, some too dangerous to be unearthed.
