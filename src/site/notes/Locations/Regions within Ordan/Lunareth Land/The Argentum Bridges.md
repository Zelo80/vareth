#SubLocation
Description:
A series of **silver archways** that connect the cityâ€™s elevated districts.
- Constructed from **lunarium**, a rare metal that absorbs moonlight and glows softly in the dark.
- At night, they appear as **paths of floating light**, creating an illusion of walking through the sky.
