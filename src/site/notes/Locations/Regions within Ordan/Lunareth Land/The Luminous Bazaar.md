#SubLocation
Description:
A **floating market**, suspended by magic, where merchants sell enchanted artifacts, potions, and stardust-infused metals.
- The streets are illuminated by hovering silver lanterns, which dim and brighten with Selnaâ€™s cycle.
- Illusionists and moon-blessed artisans craft **living paintings, ephemeral jewelry, and shimmering silks that glow under moonlight**.
