Description:
- **Meaning:** Named after the **Drakhaen Peaks**, a range of blackstone mountains that define its landscape, Drakhaen translates to _"The Land of the Unyielding."_
    
- **Government:** Ruled by a **Sovereign Archon**, a dynastic magocratic ruler who must prove mastery over **war magic and strategy** before ascending the throne.
    
- **Symbol:** A **black dragon coiled around an obsidian tower**, representing **power, endurance, and unshakable ambition**.
    
- **Capital City:** **Var’Kaelis, The Midnight Citadel** – A fortress-city built within the **cliffs of the Drakhaen Peaks**, fortified by arcane wards and **shadowforged architecture**.
    
- **Culture & Beliefs:**
    
    - Drakhaen values **discipline, magical strength, and self-reliance** above all else.
    - Unlike Lunareth’s celestial guidance, Drakhaen **does not believe in fate**—only the **will to carve one’s destiny**.
    - The **Stormlords**, an elite class of **elemental war-mages**, hold significant political power.
    - The people believe that **knowledge is only valuable if it serves a purpose**, whether in war, governance, or innovation.
- **Magic Influence:**
    
    - Specializes in **elemental manipulation, battlefield sorcery, and siege magic**.
    - War magic is **a fundamental part of Drakhaen’s education**, and all nobles must be trained in at least **one form of destructive sorcery**.
    - The kingdom is known for its **forbidden vaults of lost spells**, which they guard against outsiders.
- **Conflict:**
    
    - Though no longer at war, Drakhaen and Lunareth maintain a **tense rivalry over magical supremacy**.
    - Some Drakhaen leaders believe the **Moonborn Council of Lunareth wields too much unseen influence** over Ordan.
    - Drakhaen does not engage in prophecy or divination, **distrusting Lunareth’s claim over fate and destiny**.
    - The **Ashen Expanse**, once a war-torn battlefield between the two kingdoms, now serves as a **neutral ground** where **duels and magical tests of strength** are still held.
