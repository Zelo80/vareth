- **Lore:** Orvahn ruled Korris with an iron fist, demanding constant war and sacrifice in his name. He sought to forge the world in endless conflict, believing only the strongest deserved to exist. He was eventually defeated by **Kaelor**, who struck him down and absorbed his divine power. Now, Orvahn’s remains are said to drift across Korris, his shattered form forever burning in the moon’s crimson glow.
