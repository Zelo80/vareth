- **Domains:** Time, Knowledge, Secrets, Isolation
- **Appearance:** A towering, gaunt figure draped in celestial robes, with a face obscured by a cracked, silver mask. His body was said to shimmer like stardust, and his voice was a whisper on the wind.
- **Symbol:** A shattered hourglass within a crescent moon.![990d7c8e-8075-4428-a7bb-b70b87c759b2.webp](/img/user/Images/990d7c8e-8075-4428-a7bb-b70b87c759b2.webp)
- **Lore:** Zareth was once the keeper of time and hidden knowledge, ruling over Selnaâ€™s silver glow. He hoarded the deepest truths of the universe, believing that mortals were not meant to wield such power. He was overthrown by **Nysera**, who shattered his form and scattered his essence across the night sky. Some say he still lingers in the void, whispering forbidden knowledge to those who dare listen.
