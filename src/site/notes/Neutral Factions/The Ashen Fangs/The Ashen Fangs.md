#neutral 
Description:
- **Motto:** _“Glory is in the Graves We Leave Behind.”_
- **Philosophy:** The **Ashen Fangs** take the **jobs no one else dares accept**. Whether it's **suicidal monster hunts, assassination contracts, or battling ancient horrors**, they are known as the **most fearless, reckless, and cutthroat adventurers** in Ordan.
- **Guild Symbol:** A **wolf’s skull wreathed in black flames**, symbolizing their **embrace of death and war**.
- **Headquarters:** **The Last Oath Hall** – A **dimly lit, smoke-filled fortress-tavern** in Varethis, where **bloodstained contracts, mercenary lords, and exiled warriors** gather.

### **Guild Structure:**

- **The Fanglord** – The **ruthless and battle-hardened leader**, who rules through **brutality and survival**, not tradition.
- **The Bloodmarked** – Elite **mercenaries and warcasters**, often former **soldiers, criminals, or exiled knights**.
- **The Deathseekers** – Standard members who are **willing to take on impossible missions** for wealth, glory, or redemption.

### **Types of Contracts & Work:**

✔ Assassinations, high-profile **bounty hunting**, and **criminal warfare**.  
✔ Purging **undead-infested ruins and eldritch horrors** no sane person would face.  
✔ Large-scale **mercenary work for warring factions**.  
✔ **Artifact recovery in cursed or forbidden lands**.  
✔ Escorting high-value criminals, warlords, and dark sorcerers in secret.

### **Notable Reputation & Conflicts:**

- Feared across **Ordan**, their name is often spoken in **hushed tones**, as few survive their missions.
- Many **kingdoms hire them for deadly, high-stakes conflicts**, even when it means **violating treaties or alliances**.
- Some **Silverwardens consider them no better than war criminals**, leading to **occasional clashes between the two guilds**.
- **The Infernal Pact of Pyrelis** often **recruits from their ranks**, respecting their willingness to **sacrifice everything for power and survival**.
