#neutral 
Description:
- **Guild Philosophy:**
    
    - The **Infernal Pact** sees magic as **a weapon to be sharpened and unleashed**. They believe that **knowledge without power is useless**, and their focus is on **perfecting magic for battlefield superiority**.
    - Their spellcraft centers around **destructive magic, tactical enchantments, and spell-forged weaponry**.
- **Guild Structure:**
    
    - Ruled by the **Grand Magus of War**, a title passed only through **duel by combat**.
    - Members are ranked based on **battle performance, magical duels, and successful spellcraft trials**.
    - Divided into **Warfare Sects**:
        - **The Emberlords** – Masters of **fire magic, explosions, and siege spells**.
        - **The Arcane Blades** – Battle-mages who blend **swordsmanship with war magic**.
        - **The Riftforgers** – Specialists in **teleportation magic, battlefield manipulation, and summoning.**
- **Notable Features & Locations:**
    
    - **The Crucible Arena** – A massive coliseum where battle-mages test their spells in lethal combat.
    - **The Black Anvil** – A forge where **arcane weapons, enchanted armor, and siege spells are created**.
    - **The Pyrestone Archives** – A library of **war spells**, many of which have been banned in other kingdoms.
- **Influence & Conflicts:**
    
    - Pyrelis **sells magical weapons and mercenary battlemages** to the highest bidder, sometimes even to opposing sides of a war.
    - They **despise the Verdant Arcanum**, believing scholars who refuse to test magic in combat are **wasting their potential**.
    - Some believe that **something ancient stirs beneath the city**, influencing their magic toward **greater and greater destruction**.
