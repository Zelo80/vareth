Far from bustling cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch in the wilderness. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness primal powers of the wilderness. A Rangerâ€™s talents and magic are honed with deadly focus to protect the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.
