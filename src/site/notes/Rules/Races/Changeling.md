### **The Changelings of Ordan: The Forgotten Faces**

The **Changelings**, known as the **Faceless**, are a people without a people, an existence without a true form. Where they came from is a mystery, even to themselves. They live in the shadows of society, never truly belonging, never truly being seen for what they are. To be a Changeling in Ordan is to be **everyone and no one, all at once**.

---

## **Origins & Myths**

- Some believe the Changelings are **the shattered reflections of a dead god**, fragments of a divine being that could never settle into one form.
- Others claim they were **once Aasimar, cursed by an ancient celestial for their arrogance**, doomed to walk the world without a true self.
- A few scholars suggest they are **the unfinished work of a forgotten creator**, left incomplete and given the ability to shape themselves as they please.

Regardless of the truth, the Changelings **have no homeland, no great history carved into stone—only stories passed in whispers, their origins forever obscured in mystery**.

## **The Changeling’s Nature: A Life of Masks**

- **Changelings are not shapeshifters in the traditional sense**—they do not become others; they simply erase themselves, replacing their own face with a new one.
- Their transformations are **instinctive**, a survival trait rather than a gift, allowing them to slip between lives as easily as a river changes course.
- Many Changelings struggle with **their own identity**, questioning whether they are truly real, or just a collection of masks with nothing underneath.

## **Paths of the Faceless**

### **1. The Masqueraders (Masters of Deception & Identity)**

- **Description:** Some Changelings embrace their nature, becoming spies, infiltrators, and con artists, thriving in deception.
- **Culture & Beliefs:**
    - They see **identity as a tool**, something to be worn and discarded as needed.
    - Many operate in **noble courts and criminal underworlds**, slipping between allegiances with ease.
    - Some fear that **one day, they will wear too many faces and forget who they were entirely**.

---

### **2. The Echoed (Haunted by Forgotten Faces)**

- **Description:** These Changelings are cursed with **memories of past lives**, feeling the emotions and echoes of those they have impersonated.
- **Culture & Beliefs:**
    - Some believe they are **reincarnations of lost souls**, trapped in a cycle of endless rebirth.
    - Many are drawn to **old ruins and lost temples**, searching for a truth they do not understand.
    - Some Echoed claim that **one of their past selves was not mortal at all, but something ancient, waiting to return**.

---

### **3. The Hollow (Changelings Without a Self)**

- **Description:** Unlike others, the Hollow do not change shape out of necessity—they do so because **they have no identity at all**.
- **Culture & Beliefs:**
    - Some believe they were **never meant to exist**, mere accidents of fate.
    - They drift through the world, taking names and lives at will, **never staying in one place for too long**.
    - The most feared among them are **the Oblivion Walkers**, Changelings who have erased their own memories so many times that they have become nothing but a shifting mask.

---

## **Society & Survival**

- **Changelings have no kingdom, no great cities, and no known rulers**—they exist where others do, living among different races, wearing different lives.
- **Few know of their existence**, and those who do often **fear them**, believing them to be deceivers, cursed beings, or worse.
- Many Changelings follow a **code of secrecy**, ensuring their true nature is never revealed, lest they be hunted or used as tools of manipulation.

## **The Laws of the Nameless**

Among Changelings, a few unspoken rules have been passed down through the generations:

1. **Never be the same person for too long**—to settle in one form is to invite discovery.
2. **Truth is a weapon, but so is a lie**—control your own story, or someone else will.
3. **Remember who you were, even when you forget who you are**—for those who lose themselves may never find their way back.

## **Legends & Mysteries**

- **The Faceless One:** An ancient Changeling who has lived so many lives that they have forgotten their original name, wandering Ordan as a reflection of whoever stands before them.
- **The Mirrorborn:** Some believe there is an ancient ruin, hidden deep within the wilds, where the first Changelings were created—not born, but **forged in reflections and forgotten dreams**.
- **The Mask of Many:** A cursed relic said to contain the personalities of **every Changeling who has ever worn it**, granting its bearer power at the cost of their own identity.
