### **The Genasi of Ordan**

The **Genasi of Ordan**, known as the **Elythari**, are beings of **elemental heritage**, descendants of mortals who were **touched by the Primordials**, beings of pure elemental force that existed before the gods. Unlike other races, the **Elythari are not bound to one place or people**, instead finding their origins in the **raw forces of nature itself**. Some believe they are the **remnants of ancient pacts**, while others claim they are the **living embodiment of elemental chaos**.
