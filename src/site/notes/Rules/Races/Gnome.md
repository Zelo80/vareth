### **The Gnomes of Ordan**

The **Gnomes of Ordan**, known as the **Nyveri**, are a **mystical and elusive race**, renowned for their **unpredictable magic, ingenuity, and deep ties to the unseen forces of the world**. Unlike other mortal races, the **Nyveri do not see the world as fixed**, but as something that can be **reshaped, bent, and rewritten** through both invention and arcane manipulation.

---

## **Origins & Beliefs**

- The Nyveri believe they were **never meant to exist**, but instead are **accidents of raw magic**, formed when **the gods wove the first spells** and let loose the remnants of their craft.
- Some claim that gnomes are **fragments of a greater consciousness**, and that every Nyveri is **a piece of something that was once whole**.
- Unlike other races, gnomes do not fear **chaos**â€”they see it as **the heart of creation**, a force that should be **harnessed rather than controlled**.
