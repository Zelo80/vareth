### **The Tieflings of Ordan**

The **Tieflings of Ordan**, known as the **Zarithari**, are a people **cursed by forgotten pacts, shaped by lost empires, and feared for the blood that runs through their veins**. Unlike other worlds where tieflings are simply an anomaly, in Ordan, they are the **remnants of a past no one dares to speak of**—a people whose very existence is a mystery, and whose destiny is still unwritten.

## **Origins & The Curse of the Zarithari**

- The Tieflings claim no true homeland, only the **echoes of a shattered empire** known as **Zarithar**, a kingdom that once ruled through **pacts with beings beyond mortal understanding**.
- Some believe that the **Zarithari were once human**, but through **bargains with forgotten entities**, they **twisted their own bloodlines**, becoming something **more—and less—than mortal**.
- Others whisper that the Tieflings are **not cursed, but chosen**, marked as **the inheritors of an ancient power** that was never meant to die.
