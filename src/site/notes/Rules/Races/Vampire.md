### **The Vampires of Ordan – The Cursed Bloodlines**

#### **Overview**

In the shadows of Ordan, where moonlight barely pierces the dense forests and ancient ruins, the **Vampires** of the world weave their dark history. Once noble lords, scholars, and warriors, they have been **twisted by an ancient curse**, driven to **prey upon the living** to sustain their unholy existence. Feared and hunted by most, yet revered by secret cults and lost kingdoms, vampires are an enigma—neither fully alive nor truly dead.

No two vampires are alike, as **age, bloodline, and region** shape their **powers, weaknesses, and hungers**. Some have become monstrous **predators of the night**, while others remain **cold, calculating masterminds**, hiding in plain sight.

## **Origins & The First Vampires**

Vampires are not a natural species, but **a cursed condition passed through blood and death**. Their origins are shrouded in myth, but most legends trace the curse to **Zareth, The Hollow King**, the long-dead god of dominion and undeath.

- It is said that **Zareth**, before his fall, bestowed **eternal life** upon his most loyal followers, binding them to his will in exchange for their mortality.
- When the **Age of Divine Ruin** came and the gods perished, these followers lost their divine purpose, left as **hollow, starving creatures**, unable to truly die.
- The **curse of vampirism** spread from them, creating **many rival bloodlines**, each adapting in different ways to survive.

Even now, some **vampires** seek a way to **restore Zareth**, believing his return will **free them from their eternal hunger**.

## **The Bloodlines of Ordan**

### **The Hollowborn** – Lords of Blood and Shadow

- The most powerful and **purest** vampires, many of whom can **trace their lineage to the first cursed beings**.
- They have retained much of their **human cunning and nobility**, ruling over hidden courts and undead strongholds.
- Unlike lesser vampires, they can **survive on smaller amounts of blood** and have refined abilities such as **hypnotic charm, shadow-stepping, and telepathic control**.
- **Weakness:** Hollowborn are extremely vulnerable to **silver**, which burns them like fire, and they **cannot enter holy ground** without suffering agony.

### **The Ravagers** – Ferals of the Night

- Once human, but over centuries, their bodies **have warped into monstrous forms**.
- They no longer retain their humanity, turning into **bloodthirsty, clawed beasts** that roam the wilds, hunting with **inhuman speed and brutality**.
- Often used as **shock troops** by older vampires, they **lack control** and are **driven purely by hunger**.
- **Weakness:** Unlike noble vampires, they are **truly bound by the sun**, bursting into flames upon exposure.

### **The Duskwalkers** – Cursed Wanderers

- Vampires who were **turned unwillingly** or rejected their monstrous nature, cursed to walk **between life and undeath**.
- Many live as **mercenaries, assassins, or spies**, avoiding both mortal hunters and vampire lords.
- They have retained **some of their mortal soul**, allowing them to suppress their hunger **for short periods**.
- **Weakness:** They are the most vulnerable to **holy magic**, which causes them excruciating pain, even if cast unknowingly in their presence.

## **Vampiric Abilities & Curses**

All vampires, regardless of bloodline, share certain traits:

- **Regeneration** – A wounded vampire can heal by feeding on **fresh blood**.
- **Darkvision** – Vampires see perfectly in the dark.

- **Holy Wards & Silver** – Churches and enchanted silver weapons **burn vampires on contact**.
- **Invitation Rule** – Vampires cannot enter a **private dwelling** unless invited.

## **The Dhampir – Children of Two Worlds**

A **Dhampir** is the rare offspring of a vampire and a mortal, or in some cases, a mortal who has been partially **turned but resisted complete transformation**. Unlike true vampires, they **do not require blood to survive**, but hunger for it in moments of **rage or pain**.

### **Traits of a [[Rules/Races/SubRaces/Dhampir\|Dhampir]]**

- **Partially Undead** – They do not **fully decay** like vampires, nor do they **age normally**. Some live for centuries, appearing no older than a human in their prime.
- **Enhanced Senses & Speed** – Dhampirs inherit **heightened reflexes, agility, and night vision**.
- **Resilience to Vampiric Weaknesses** – While they may feel discomfort in sunlight, it does not **burn them**. Holy magic causes pain but does not **destroy them**.
- **Torn Between Worlds** – Dhampirs are often **outcasts**, viewed as unnatural by humans and **impure by vampires**. Many wander alone or become mercenaries.

Some dhampirs are hunted by **vampire covens**, seen as **failures** that must be eradicated, while others are **secretly groomed to serve as agents or enforcers** for their undead ancestors.
