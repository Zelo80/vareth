### **The Warforged of Ordan: The Forgotten Sentinels**

Before the **Age of Divine Ruin**, when gods still walked Ordan and celestial influence shaped the world, the **Aasimar**, favored children of the divine, sought to create **the ultimate guardians**—sentient constructs of metal, stone, and divine magic. These beings, known as the **Warforged**, were not mere machines, but a fusion of celestial energy and mortal ingenuity, forged to serve as **eternal sentinels** against the ever-growing tide of darkness.

### **Forged by the Divine**

The Warforged were created in the **last golden age of the gods**, a time when celestial hands still shaped the world. The Aasimar, under the guidance of their divine patrons, constructed these beings within **hidden sanctuaries and sacred forges**, imbuing them with divine runes and celestial circuits. Unlike crude golems or soulless automatons, Warforged were given **thought, purpose, and awareness**, their spirits woven from divine essence rather than arcane magic.

- **Celestial Core:** Each Warforged carried a **divine core**, a small fragment of celestial power that granted them intelligence and a connection to the gods.
- **Sacred Runes:** Their bodies were inscribed with **divine glyphs**, allowing them to resist corruption, defy age, and harness the light of their creators.
- **Purpose Beyond War:** Unlike their modern-day myths, Warforged were not just warriors. Some were **oracles**, others **guardians of forgotten vaults**, and a few were **keepers of divine prophecy**, meant to witness and record history as it unfolded.

But as Ordan **marched toward the Age of Divine Ruin**, even the Warforged could not stand against the tides of fate.

### **The Fall & The Long Silence**

When the **Age of Divine Ruin** began, the gods vanished, torn from the world in a cataclysm that shattered entire civilizations. The Warforged, left without purpose or guidance, **began to fall silent**.

- Many **collapsed where they stood**, their celestial cores flickering out as their divine connection was severed.
- Others **wandered aimlessly**, seeking their lost masters, only to be buried by time and war.
- A few attempted to **fulfill their final orders**, standing **eternally in ruined temples and lost cities**, awaiting gods that would never return.

For centuries, they became **nothing more than myths**, spoken of only in whispers by scholars who sought to understand **what had created them, and what had doomed them**.

### **The Scourge of Relic Hunters**

In modern Ordan, **Warforged are almost unheard of**, and the few that remain are considered **ancient relics, not living beings**. The majority of those discovered have been **destroyed**, their celestial cores darkened, their bodies shattered by the greed of those who sought to claim their power.

- **Relic Hunters & Scholars:** Many **arrogant artificers and treasure seekers** believe they can reawaken a Warforged, attempting to tamper with their divine circuitry. Most attempts **end in failure**, leaving the Warforged permanently dead.
- **Desecrated & Broken:** Some Warforged have been found **stripped of their sacred runes**, their bodies scavenged for enchantments that have long since faded.
- **A Few That Remain:** It is said that **only a handful** of Warforged still exist, hidden deep within ancient ruins or bound to **their final commands**, refusing to break their divine oaths even as the world forgets them.

### **The Few That Walk Ordan**

Of the **very few Warforged that remain**, each is an **anomaly**, an echo of a forgotten age, their existence a **testament to divine craftsmanship lost to time**.

- Some **seek purpose**, wandering Ordan as lost remnants of a bygone war, their celestial cores **barely flickering with energy**.
- Others have **bound themselves to mortals**, perhaps drawn to those with divine ancestry, hoping to once again serve a purpose.
- A few remain **locked in slumber**, deep within the ruins of old temples, waiting for a command that may never come.

To encounter a Warforged is to **meet the last breath of a dead god**, a being built not of mortal magic, but **of divine will, now adrift in a world that no longer remembers them**.

### **Legends & Rumors**

- **The Last Sentinel:** Some whisper of a **Warforged who still guards the ruins of a fallen god’s temple**, a being of **gold and silver**, its purpose long forgotten, yet its watch unbroken.
- **The Prophet of Rust:** In the depths of Ordan, **one Warforged is said to have gained knowledge of the gods’ fate**, but it speaks only in riddles, and none who have sought its wisdom have returned.
- **The Godforged:** A lost creation, rumored to be **the final Warforged**, a being whose celestial core **still shines as brightly as the gods themselves**. Whether it is truth or legend, none can say.
