Synopsis:
The party traveled to Veyl'thir after escaping the ambush and made a shopping adventure before returning to the Adventurers guild and recruited to clear out duskrun for good. The party accepted becoming members of the Silverwardens and made their way back to duskrun hollow. They saw the now cleared road and made their way back to the camp finding it empty then into the deeper part of the canyons finding it abandoned with campfires. They eventually found a hollow spot in the canyon leading into a cave filled with the goblins of the duskrun raiders. They killed Snaggle the Whisper and discovered a scroll that was translated by Cayne. We pick up in the cave.
